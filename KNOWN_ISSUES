#TESTAR v1.1a (2015-09-22)
--------------------------

- Graphical environment
	-> Color = 32bit required
		=> Using remote desktop with lower color (i.e. 16bit) will result on an "Unable to update layered window" error message (@console)

- System Under Test (SUT)
	-> Browsers support for Web applications
		=> Internet explorer x86 (32 bit executable) will result on a "System is offline! I assume it crashed" error message (@console)
		=> Mozilla Firefox: scrollbars not being detected (not compliant with Accessiblity API)
		=> Google Chrome: web application widgets not being detected

- Protocol
	-> Editing
		-> "ReferenceError: "ImportPackage" is not defined in <eval> at line number 2" error message
			=> Just ignore the message (due to outdated library jsyntaxpane-0.9.5-b29)
	-> Compilation
		-> "JDK required (running inside of JRE) error" error message
			=> make sure you are running TESTAR with Java JDK version (not JRE version)
		
- Console error messages
	-> "System is offline! I assume it crashed"
		=> Check whether the SUT is already running. In such a case, first close any SUT process beforehand.
