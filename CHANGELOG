#TESTAR v1.1a (2015-09-22)
--------------------------

Enhancements:
	- Widgets hierarchy (Spy mode):
		-> which are the parents widgets? ... Shortcut: Ctrl
	- Test sequence graphs:
		-> Which SUT UI States did a test sequence traversed?
		-> Which SUT UI Actions were executed?
		-> .dot/.svg graphs:
			--> minimal: states/actions repetition number
			--> tiny: states/actions identificators (+ minimal info)
			--> screenshoted (+ tiny info)
		-> Test sequence reporting (including #states, #actions, verdict)
	- Test sequence generators:
		-> Q-Learning (more clever action selection than Random)
	- GenerateManual mode (Shortcut: Shift + Left/Right arrow from Spy/Generate modes):
		-> Blended testing: let TESTAR do it automatically or take the control at any time!
		
Improvements
	- Widgets recognition ("Internet Explorer" browser):
		-> scrollbars
		-> modal windows
	- Widgets filtering helper (by Title):
		-> ClickFilterLayerProtocol enables to (under Spy mode):
			--> add widget title to a filter list (displayed at console) ... Shortcut: Shift + Left click
			--> remove widget title from a filter list (displayed at console) ... Shortcut: Shift + Right click
	- Performance:
		-> Disk space
			-> GZIP streams for test sequence serialisation
			-> Test sequence UI screenshots moved from the serialisation to a shared repository for TESTAR and Graphs (.png format)
			
Fixes
	- Widgets properties (Spy mode ... Shortcut: Shift + 3):
		-> Properties window displayed inside Screen (sometimes it was outside)
		-> Parent Roles property displayed multi-line (single line truncated roles)
	- Test sequence logs:
		-> Detailed action execution (widgets without Title made hard to manually reproduce a sequence from the log)
	- Manual testing:
		-> User events (Left/Right clicks and typing) are captured by TESTAR (user events were lost in the test sequence, hence non replayable)
	- Minor bugs fixes

Experimental:
	- AdhocTest mode (Shortcut: Shift + Enter from Spy/Generate modes):
		-> activates a server to listen to test sequences (port 47357)
			--> format (one action per line): <action_type(parameters*)>\r\n (i.e. LC(100.0,50,5))
